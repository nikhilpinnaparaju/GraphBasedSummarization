Hurricane Gilbert swept toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted its heavily populated south coast to prepare 
for high winds, heavy rains
and high seas. The National Weather Service
in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a "broad
area of cloudiness and heavy weather" rotating around the center of the storm. Strong
winds associated with Gilbert brought coastal flooding, strong southeast winds and up
to 12 feet to Puerto Ricoâ€™s south coast.
